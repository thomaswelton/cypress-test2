## Getting Started
1. Run `pnpm i` in root folder to install all dev and package dependencies
2. After dependencies have been installed run `pnpm dev:app. Go to `http://localhost:3050/`, dummy app should be running there
3. In separate terminal tab run `pnpm cypress:open`. Try running the single test in there, it should break
